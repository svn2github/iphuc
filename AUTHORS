iPhoneInterface was originally created by nightwatch, without whom no iPhone de-jailing, or 3rd party code execution would be possible.

Subsequent versions of iPhoneInterface were developed by geohot, ixtli and nall.

The final version of iPhoneInterface was a backport of new functionality released by geohot in a tool called 'newgshell'.

This application (iPHUC) represents all of the splintered development (jailbreak, iActivator, newgshell, ipi) brought into a package that is maintainable and opensource under the GPL.

Warren, nall, mjc, and Operator were the initial contributors to iPHUC.

Subsequently, patches and tinkering have been officially offered by the following:
