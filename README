iPHoneUtilityClient v0.5
========================

An AFC client meant to interface with the iPhone.

NOTE: Currently getting this to build in windows is probably a HUGE pain.  If someone would like to contribute to the windows side of this app please let us known in #iphone.iphuc on irc.osx86.hu

OS X Build Instructions:

1)	Make sure you have readline from macports.

As os x readline does not provide certain features we require, please install macports (www.macports.org) and use it to build the most recent version of readline.

2)	Retrieve a copy of the most recent MobileDevice.h from http://iphone.fiveforty.net/wiki/index.php?title=MobileDevice.h and save it to this directory.  We apologize for this inconvenience.

3)  Execute the following commands from within this directory:
	./autogen.sh && ./configure --with-readline=/opt/local && make
	
4)	Execute iPHUC by typing
	./iPHUC


Soon we will include a script that will automate jailbreak, ssh installation, etc... just hold tight.

Known Issues:
If you attempt to putfile a file with size of zero, it messes up the AFC connection.  Restart iPHUC
